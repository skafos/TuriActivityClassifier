# Turi Activity Classifier

**DEPRECATION WARNING**

This code example was intended for use by the legacy Skafos platform and is no longer being maintained. On 05/29/2019, a new version of [Skafos](https://skafos.ai) was released, streamlining model delivery to the edge.

The following repo contains code for training an activity classifier model on Skafos using the [Turi Create framework](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/activity_classifier/).  The example model was trained on data generated from a watchOS data collection experiment. Given a sequence of motion-sensory readings from an edge device, this model will classify the most likely activity: sitting, standing, or moving.
  
## What is here?
-  `activity_classifier.ipynb` - A Python notebook that trains and saves an activity classifier model to use in your app. Start here.
-  `utilities/` - a directory that contains helper functions used by `activity_classifier.ipynb`.
-  `advanced_usage/` - a directory that contains additional information about this activity classification model, how to incorporate your own data, and additional example models.
-  `requirements.txt` - a file describing all required Python dependencies.

## About the model
-  The activity classifier creates a deep learning model, including both convolutional and recurrent layers. It's capable of detecting temporal features in sensor data, lending itself well to the task of activity classification.
-  Once trained, you can give the model a sequence of motion-sensory readings generated by a handheld device, and it will classify the current activity as either sitting, standing, or moving.
-  The main activity classifier example follows a [3-part blog series](https://medium.com/metis-machine/activity-classification-for-watchos-part-1-542d44388c40) that details an example watchOS app: data collection, model creation, and deployment.
